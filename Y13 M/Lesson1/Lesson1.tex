    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Prove if $n^2$ is even then $n$ is even. [Hint: Use proof by contradiction]
        \item Split into partial fractions \[\frac{3x}{(x-2)(x+1)}\]
        \item Use factor theorem to factorise $x^3 -4x^2 +x +6$.
        \item If $f(x) = x^2$. What is $f(x+1)$? What about $f(-x)$?
        \item Here are the first 4 terms of a sequence: 2, 5, 8, 11. Can you find the 20th term?
        Work out \[\sum^{20}_{n=1} (2+4(n-1))\]
        \item Work out the terms up to $x^3$ in the binomial expansion of $\sqrt{(4-9x)}$.
