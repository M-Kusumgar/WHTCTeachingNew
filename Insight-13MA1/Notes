Much more animated teaching style
What is the first thing to do in the exam (ask a student about their approach)
Ask student to check again if they arrive at a different answers
Look this way quickly, eye contact for attention if student isnt listening
Student may not precisely answer question, just say yh and lead them to the right direction
Quiet from everybody in 3,2,1, good as students are conditioned to this
Going around and seeing how everyone is doing one by one
Getting students to mark their own work (listen out for Whaaa?)
When student makes a silly mistake, explain for everyone else's benefit


Students cannot see the board from the back
Students struggle more with the english of the question rather than the maths
