Underline and define keywords in questions and ask for interaction
First explicit method --> main steps with whiteboards/discussion --> one their own
Picking on people if noone answers
Any questions? after every example
How does this question differ from previous question?
Helping student with prev question while the rest do another question so people can work at different paces
Is this the best way to help though, the problem may be deeper? Will the student be overwhelmed if I 
ask them to come to the office after school?
Make sure you have a good whiteboard pen and eraser

Lots of silence due to large class, I will try to have very little silence unless students are thinking hard
mv-mu can be factorised? because mass is constant. Doesnt affect anything actually so student was right
I should have a hard think about whether the student is saying something valid and let them think in their way
Students are getting a lot of things correct? Is it beneficial to keep doing that many questions on the same
formula with slight variance?
